# video-insights

Candidate **per-video** analytics and site copy — formal definitions only. Implementation deferred; capture ideas so we do not forget.

Parent: `generate-stats-table`  
Depends on: `chart_points` column (shipped), raw episodes, processed stats  
Grain: **video** (`video_title`) for most insights; **`other-multi-version-songs`** groups by song key (artist + song) — needs title parser ([`title_parse/`](../../pipeline/src/evtop20/title_parse/) in `package`).

## Site sections (v1)

Insights will be grouped on the static site under four headings:

| Site section | Insight id | Summary |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Year insights** | [`year-classics`](#year-classics) | Old uploads (contest year C) still charting often |
| | [`year-post-contest-legacy`](#year-post-contest-legacy) | How year-C uploads perform after the next ESC (from June C+1) |
| **Country insights** | [`country-presence-heatmap`](#country-presence-heatmap) | Heatmap: country × episode month (chart presence) |
| **ESC winner insights** | [`esc-april-pulse`](#esc-april-pulse) | Winner upload in April Y top 10? |
| | [`esc-may-crown`](#esc-may-crown) | Winner upload at rank 1 in May Y? |
| **Other** | [`dominant-leaders`](#dominant-leaders) | Small GOAT cluster with huge `chart_points` gap |
| | [`other-never-top1-leader`](#other-never-top1-leader) | Best `chart_points` among uploads that never hit rank 1 |
| | [`other-multi-version-songs`](#other-multi-version-songs) | Songs with multiple upload variants on the chart |

**Related (not in this task):** contest-year **season wave** charts and year heatmap live under [`contest-season-waves.md`](contest-season-waves.md) — same **Year insights** site tab as a viz sibling, not a separate numbered insight here.

## Year insights

Contest **edition year C** parsed from `video_title` (e.g. `#Eurovision2020`, “Eurovision 2020”). Shared parse rules with [`contest-season-waves.md`](contest-season-waves.md).

### year-classics

**Question:** Which **old** uploads still show up in the monthly top 20 often?

**Age:** contest year **C** from title. Age at episode \((Y, M)\):

\[
\text{age}(Y, M) = Y - C
\]

(Adjust if \(M < 4\) and we care about “Eurovision year” vs calendar — TBD.)

**Classic (v0):**

- \(\text{age}(Y, M) \ge 10\) at episode date.
- **Appearance rate** over a window of episodes \(\mathcal{E}\):

\[
r = \frac{\#\{ E \in \mathcal{E} : \text{video in top 20 in raw episode } E \}}{|\mathcal{E}|}
\]

- **Classic** if \(r \ge p\) (suggested **\(p = 0.5\)**) and age ≥ 10 in at least half of \(\mathcal{E}\).

**Window \(\mathcal{E}\) (pick one at implement time):**

- Last **12** episode months in corpus, or
- All episodes with `period >= (C + 10, 1)`.

**Output (future):** `video_title`, contest year C, age, \(r\), episode count.

**Open later:** parse failures; LIVE vs Official as one “classic” entity (song stats); minimum \(|\mathcal{E}|\) (e.g. ≥ 6 episodes).

---

### year-post-contest-legacy

**Question:** After the **next** Eurovision is over, how well do uploads from contest year **C** still perform on the channel chart?

**Why wait until June C+1:** Eurovision **C+1** final is ~May C+1. June C+1 is the first episode month **after** that final — current-year hype for C+1 has peaked; year-**C** uploads are judged in “legacy” conditions, not during their own season.

**Measurement window:**

\[
S_C = (C+1,\ 6) \qquad\text{(June of year } C+1\text{)}
\]

\[
\mathcal{W}_C = \{ E : \text{episode period}(E) \ge S_C \}
\]

Only episodes that exist in the corpus count (episode months only — no gap fill).

**Cohort:** \(V_C\) = all distinct `video_title` with contest year \(C\).

**Per-year stats (one row per contest year C that has any \(V_C\) and any \(\mathcal{W}_C\)):**

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| `cohort_size` | \(\|V_C\|\) |
| `active_videos` | \(\#\{ v \in V_C : v \text{ appears in top 20 in some } E \in \mathcal{W}_C \}\) |
| `top20_appearances` | \(\sum_{v \in V_C} \#\{ E \in \mathcal{W}_C : v \text{ rank} \le 20 \text{ in } E \}\) |
| `chart_points_gained` | \(\sum_{v \in V_C} \bigl( P_v^{\text{end}} - P_v^{\text{start}} \bigr)\) |

Where:

- \(P_v^{\text{end}}\) = `chart_points` for \(v\) in the **latest** cumulative snapshot (or snapshot at end of \(\mathcal{W}_C\)).
- \(P_v^{\text{start}}\) = `chart_points` for \(v\) in the last cumulative snapshot with period **strictly before** \(S_C\) (if none, treat as 0).

Optional derived:

\[
\text{activity_rate} = \frac{\text{active_videos}}{\text{cohort_size}}, \qquad
\text{avg_points_gained} = \frac{\text{chart_points_gained}}{\text{cohort_size}}
\]

**Output (future):** table keyed by contest year C; optional leader row (video from \(V_C\) with largest points gained in window).

**Open later:** parse contest year from titles; years with no June C+1 episode yet (window empty); compare cohorts across C on one chart; song-grain roll-up.

## Country insights

### country-presence-heatmap

**Question:** How does each **participating country** show up on the Most Watched chart over episode months — same compact heatmap as contest-year waves ([`contest-season-waves.md`](contest-season-waves.md) §C), but **rows = country** instead of contest year C.

**Why country:** contest-year heatmaps answer “when did ESC 2024 dominate?”; country heatmaps answer “when did **Ukraine** / **Sweden** / **Italy** dominate?” — useful for diaspora interest, winner spikes, and long-running national catalogues.

**Country K** for a video: parsed from `video_title` via [`title_parse/`](../../pipeline/src/evtop20/title_parse/) in `package` — prefer human **`country`** name; fall back to flag emoji → country lookup if name missing. Unparsed titles → **unknown** bucket (optional separate row or excluded from heatmap).

**Building blocks** (same episode timeline as year heatmap in contest-season-waves):

| Building block | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Country K** | Participating country attached to the upload |
| **Presence in month M** | Distinct `video_title` with country K appears in episode M (any rank ≤ 20) |
| **New entries in month M** | K-videos whose **first seen** in top 20 == M |

Episode months only — x-axis is **episode timeline**, not every calendar month (gaps honest).

**Per-country metrics (mirror contest-year wave metrics):**

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| `presence_by_month[K, M]` | # of distinct K-videos in top 20 in episode M |
| `new_by_month[K, M]` | # of K-videos with `first_seen == M` |
| `peak_month[K]` | Month with max `presence_by_month` for K |
| `total_presence[K]` | \(\sum_M \texttt{presence\_by\_month}[K, M]\) — row sort key |

**Heatmap (site viz — same encoding as year heatmap §C):**

| Axis | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Rows** | Country K (sort: `total_presence` desc, then name) |
| **Columns** | Episode month `YYYY-MM` |
| **Color** | `presence_by_month` (default) or toggle **`new_by_month`** |
| **Scale** | Sequential theme tokens (`--chart-seq-low` → `--chart-seq-high`) per [`site-theming.md`](site-theming.md) |

**Procedure:**

1. Walk all raw episodes in period order.
2. For each entry with rank ≤ 20 and non-empty `video_title`, parse country K.
3. Update `presence_by_month` and track `first_seen` per `video_title`.
4. Emit matrix for site (or share `contest-season-waves.json` envelope with a `by_country` section).

**Output (future):** heatmap component + hover month → list top K-videos that month; optional filter (e.g. only `grand_final_live` uploads).

**Open later:** dual citizenship / artist country vs song country; “Rest of World” non-ESC uploads in titles; rank-weighted color (`chart_points` sum per K per month); compare side-by-side with contest-year heatmap tab; minimum parse rate before showing chart.

## ESC winner insights

Require external **winner** data per contest year Y ([`eurovision-final-place.md`](eurovision-final-place.md)). Winner → channel `video_title` matching rules TBD (any variant vs Official only).

### esc-april-pulse

**Question:** Did an upload for the **Eurovision winner of year Y** appear in the **April Y** Most Watched episode top 10?

**Why April:** episodes align with pre-contest season (`period.month == 4`, `period.year == Y`).

**Procedure (per contest year Y):**

1. Load raw episode `period = {year: Y, month: 4}` if it exists → else **unknown** (no episode).
2. Resolve **winner** for Y from external data (artist + song / country).
3. Match winner to one or more channel `video_title` rows (Official Video, LIVE, etc.) — matching rules TBD.
4. **Hit** if any matched upload has **rank ≤ 10** in that episode’s `entries`.
5. **Miss** if episode exists, winner known, match found, but best rank > 10.
6. **Unknown** if episode missing, winner missing, or no confident title match.

**Output (future):** table year × {hit | miss | unknown} + rank + matched `video_title`.

**Open later:** fuzzy match quality; count “any variant” vs “Official Video only”; compare with [`esc-may-crown`](#esc-may-crown).

---

### esc-may-crown

**Question:** Was an upload for the **Eurovision winner of year Y** at **rank 1** in the **May Y** Most Watched episode?

**Why May:** Grand Final is in May; the May episode is the natural “right after the show” chart (`period.month == 5`, `period.year == Y`).

**Procedure (per contest year Y):**

1. Load raw episode `period = {year: Y, month: 5}` if it exists → else **unknown** (no episode).
2. Resolve **winner** for Y from external data (artist + song / country).
3. Match winner to one or more channel `video_title` rows — same rules as [`esc-april-pulse`](#esc-april-pulse).
4. **Hit** if any matched upload has **rank == 1** in that episode’s `entries`.
5. **Miss** if episode exists, winner known, match found, but best rank ≠ 1 (include actual rank).
6. **Unknown** if episode missing, winner missing, or no confident title match.

**Output (future):** table year × {hit | miss | unknown} + rank + matched `video_title`.

**Open later:** LIVE vs Official Video; winner at #1 in **June Y** if May episode missing; pair with [`esc-april-pulse`](#esc-april-pulse) (April top 10 → May #1) as a season arc.

## Other

Insights that are not keyed by contest year, country, or ESC winner.

### dominant-leaders

**Question:** Which uploads sit in a small top group with a large gap to everyone else (“greatest of all time”)?

**v0 metric:** `chart_points` only (latest cumulative snapshot).

**Procedure:**

1. Take rows from `-latest`, sort by `chart_points` descending → \(P_1 \ge P_2 \ge \cdots\).
2. Find the **smallest** rank \(k \ge 1\) such that the relative gap below the cluster is large:

\[
\frac{P_k - P_{k+1}}{P_k} \ge g
\]

Use \(P_{k+1} = 0\) if \(k = n\) (only one video). Suggested default: **\(g = 0.25\)** (25% drop after rank \(k\)).

3. **Leader cluster** = videos at ranks \(1 \ldots k\).
4. **Insight fires** when \(k \le 3\) (small cluster) **and** \(P_k - P_{k+1} \ge m\) for an absolute floor **\(m\)** (e.g. 50 points) — avoids calling a gap “huge” on tiny totals.

**Output (future):** list of `video_title` + `chart_points` in cluster, gap to next, snapshot date.

**Open later:** tune \(g\), \(m\), \(k\); use `-latest` vs a fixed season; show on site as badge or callout in this section.

---

### other-never-top1-leader

**Question:** Which upload has the **best chart performance** (`chart_points`) among those that **never reached rank 1** in any episode?

**Why:** Highlights strong “always a bridesmaid” hits — high cumulative tier weight without ever topping a monthly chart. Contrast with [`dominant-leaders`](#dominant-leaders) (includes #1 appearances).

**Score:** `chart_points` from `-latest` ([`chart_points.md`](../faq/chart_points.md) — not ESC final score).

**Procedure (v0 — video grain):**

1. Take rows from `eurovision-top-20-alltime-latest.json`.
2. **Eligible** iff `top1 == 0` (never rank 1 in any included episode).
3. Sort eligible by `chart_points` descending, then `top3` … `top20`, then `video_title` (same tie-break as default stats sort).
4. **Leader** = first row(s) after sort; report ties if `chart_points` equal.

**Optional metrics for context:** `top3`, `top10`, `top20` on the leader row; gap to next eligible row.

**Output (future):** highlight card or table row — `video_title`, `chart_points`, best tier reached (e.g. “best rank implied: top 3 only” from tier counts — TBD), snapshot date.

**Song grain (defer):** when song stats exist (packaged song stats (`data/packaged/per-song/`)), same rule on rolled-up rows: eligible if summed `top1 == 0`, leader by summed `chart_points` across variants.

**Open later:** minimum `chart_points` floor to avoid noise; list top 5 eligible not only #1. (Flexible period range shipped in 0.1.0.)

---

### other-multi-version-songs

**Question:** How many **songs** appear on the chart as **multiple uploads** (Official Video, LIVE, National Final, etc.)?

**Grain:** Grouped by **song key** (`artist` + `song` from [`title_parse/`](../../pipeline/src/evtop20/title_parse/) in `package`) — not raw `video_title`. One song can map to several video rows in stats.

**Corpus:** all rows in `eurovision-top-20-alltime-latest.json` (cumulative — any upload that ever contributed to tier counts).

**Procedure:**

1. For each stats row, parse `video_title` → song key (skip / warn if incomplete).
2. Group rows by song key; for each key, count **distinct** `video_title` values → **variant count** \(n\).
3. Bucket songs:

| Bucket | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **2 versions** | \(n = 2\) |
| **3 versions** | \(n = 3\) |
| **3+ versions** | \(n \ge 4\) |

(Optional baseline: **1 version** = \(n = 1\) — singles on chart with only one upload.)

4. Report **counts** per bucket and **share** of all parsed songs:

\[
\text{share}_{\text{bucket}} = \frac{\#\{\text{songs in bucket}\}}{\#\{\text{all songs with } n \ge 2\}}
\]

(or denominator = all songs including singles — pick at implement time).

**Output (future):** summary table + optional drill-down (song key → list of `video_title` + per-variant `chart_points`).

**Example interpretation:** “42 songs chart as exactly two uploads; 18 as three; 7 as four or more.”

**Open later:** depends on `title_parse`; parse failures excluded from denominator or listed separately; same breakdown per contest year C; site bar chart; song-stats table cross-check; **`official_lyric_video`** — count as own variant vs merge with Official Music Video (TBD).
